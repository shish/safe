**This project will be moving back to thecodingmachine/safe**

The thecodingmachine team woke up from hibernation and added me as a
maintainer of `thecodingmachine/safe` so that I can continue my work
over there rather than having a hard fork <3

As of 2024/12/04, we are currently working on a new release, so if
you really need Safe with PHP 8.4 compatibility _today_ then it
still makes sense to use this, but in the next couple of weeks it
should be safe to use thecodingmachine/safe again :)
